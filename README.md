simple task manager (HW8 FL14 EPAM course)

As a final user of any documentation I do believe that it should be:
- always up to date;
- specific terms should be explained in additional chapters;
- should contain "examples";
- documentation should be divided on logical understandable parts, not to over welcome readers.
